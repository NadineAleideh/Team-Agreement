While each team member has their strengths, there is also a shared goal of developing greater strength in certain professional competencies. The team has identified the following areas for development:
Technical Skills: All team members aim to enhance their technical skills, including learning new frameworks or tools that can improve project efficiency and code quality, such as react bootstrap that we will focus on to build a nice professional design.
Collaboration and Teamwork: We agree about the importance of effective collaboration and teamwork. we want to have an open communication and  learn from each other's expertise.

- Approaching Day-to-Day Work:
To ensure that every team member understands all aspects of the project, we will make sure to:
1. Stay in touch
2.  Knowledge sharing
3.  Making meetings in a constant way, and all of us should attend all meetings
4. Document everything

# Conflict Plan

1. **Open Communication**: When conflicts arise, the team will encourage open and honest communication among all members involved. Each member will have an opportunity to express their perspective and concerns without interruption.

2. **Active Listening**: All team members will actively listen to each other, striving to understand different viewpoints and underlying reasons for disagreement. This includes giving everyone a chance to fully express their thoughts before responding.

3. **Seek Common Ground**: The team will focus on finding common ground and shared objectives. By identifying areas of agreement, the team can work towards a resolution that aligns with the project's goals and satisfies the needs of all involved.

4. **Collaboration and Compromise**: The team will promote a collaborative environment, encouraging members to work together to find mutually acceptable solutions. This may involve brainstorming alternative approaches, considering different ideas, and being open to compromise when necessary.

5. **Mediation**: If the conflict persists and the team is unable to resolve it on their own, they may seek mediation from a neutral party, such as a project manager or a designated team lead. The mediator will help facilitate discussions and guide the team towards a resolution.



# Communication Plan

- The hours will you be available to communicate: We would make ourselfs available during regular working hours, typically from 10 AM to 4 PM.
- Clear communication channels would be established to address urgent matters outside of regular working hours.Communication Platforms:
For real-time conversations and quick updates, tools like Slack, Discord and Zoom Meetings would be suitable.
- Breaks and Time Management: Regular breaks are essential for maintaining productivity and preventing burnout. we would encourage team members to take short breaks throughout the day and Longer breaks, such as lunch breaks.
- Falling Behind and Support: If we start to fall behind or encounter challenges, we would communicate this to the team promptly. We would assess the situation together, identify potential solutions, and adjust timelines or resource allocation if needed.
- Communication Beyond Working Hours and on weekend: For urgent matters or time-sensitive issues, we would establish a clear protocol for after-hours communication. And we will use the same communication platforms that we determined to use.
- Ensuring Everyone's Voice is Heard: Regular meetings and check-ins would be scheduled to provide opportunities for updates, discussions, and sharing ideas. Encouraging open dialogue, active listening, and valuing diverse perspectives would be key in ensuring everyone's voice is heard.
- Creating a Safe Environment: We would foster a supportive and respectful team culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up. Emphasize psychological safety, emphasizing that all ideas and opinions are valued and will be considered. Encourage constructive feedback and provide guidelines for communication that promote kindness, empathy, and inclusivity.

# Work Plan

To track equal contribution and prevent isolated efforts, I'll break down tasks, assign them fairly, and monitor progress. We'll use The ***"Trello"*** project management tool for visibility and communication. Collaboration will be encouraged through meetings, code reviews, and knowledge sharing. Task rotation will promote cross-functional skills.


# Git Process

**Components on GitHub:**
The entire project, including source code, documentation, and any relevant project assets, will live on GitHub. This ensures centralized version control and collaboration for the entire team.

**Sharing the Repository:**
The team leader will create an organization on GitHub and create a 2 repos one for the backend and the another for the frontend and make the invitations to the team members, so they will have an access. Each member will be added as a collaborator with appropriate permissions to contribute, push changes, and manage branches.

**Git Flow:**
The team will follow the feature branch workflow, which involves the following steps:

***Branch Creation:*** When starting a new task or feature, each team member will create a new branch based on the sub-main development branch. The branch names will be named with the team members names.

***Development:*** Team members will work on their respective branches, making incremental commits as they progress. It is important to commit regularly and write clear and concise commit messages to maintain a well-documented history of changes.

***Pull Requests (PR):*** Once a task or feature is complete, the team member will create a pull request on GitHub to merge their branch into the sub-main development branch (merging party) at the end of the day.
